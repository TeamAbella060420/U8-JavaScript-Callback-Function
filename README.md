# U8-JavaScript-Callback-Function
 
1. What is a Callback? - A callback is function like any other, but it's what you do with it that's different. Instead of calling the function manually, you're passing the name of the function to another function to execute. One called callbackFunction and another called executeCallback. Both have the word callback in their names, but they don't need to. They're just the names that describe what the functions are or do.
